    <h1><strong></strong></h1>
    <strong><br>
      1) What is Agile Development model and explain about different
      methodologies in Agile Software development?
    </strong><br>
    Agile Development model is an Incremental or iterative model,
    It has several methodologies,<br>
    &nbsp;Types of Agile Methodologies
    <br>
    <ul>
      <li>Scrum </li>
      <li>Extreme Programming (XP) </li>
      <li>Agile Unified Process (AUP)</li>
      <li>Dynamic Systems Development Method (DSDM)
      </li>
      <li> Essential Unified Process (EssUP) </li>
      <li>Exia Process (ExP) </li>
      <li>Feature Driven Development (FDD) </li>
      <li>Open Unified Process (OpenUP) </li>
      <li>Crystal Clear </li>
      <li>Velocity tracking
      </li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <strong>2) What is the difference between Agile and Waterfall Model?</strong><br>
    &nbsp;Difference between Agile and Waterfall Model:
    <br>
    <ul>
      <li>The main advantage is the backward scalability in Agile. Under
        waterfall approach we cannot change the decisions and implementations
        that we had made under the previous stages. If we want to make changes
        under waterfall we will have to build the entire project from the
        scratch once again.
      </li>
      <li>The flexibility to error check under any part of the development stage
        makes Agile more bug free and less erroneous as compared to Waterfall
        which can only test bugs at the end of the development module.
      </li>
      <li>Since Agile provides flexibility to make changes as per customer
        requirements it is more inclined towards better client satisfaction.
        This is a real set back for the Waterfall model which doesn’t allow any
        modifications once the module has been completed.
      </li>
      <li>Under Agile development modular partitioning of the software can be
        effectively carried out as compared to its counterpart. Though both of
        them allows option for segregation the later lacks the modifications in
        the implementation stage. The rules are set down before the commencement
        of the project hence it hinders further break down of the logical
        module. Whereas Agile can be of great help under such situations and can
        allow simultaneous development of different modules at the same time as
        per time bound requirement. If we want the project to be more segregated
        Agile comes as a pain relief for developers.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <strong>3) How Agile is different?</strong><br>
    Agile is different because
    <br>
    <ul>
      <li>Greater Collaboration.
      </li>
      <li>Shorter work cycle and constant feedback. </li>
      <li>Need to embrace Change.
      </li>
      <li>Greater flexibility.
      </li>
      <li>Greater discipline.
      </li>
      <li>Greater stakeholder accountability.
      </li>
      <li>Greater range of skills.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <strong>4) What are the implications for testing in Agile?
    </strong><br>
    <ul>
      <li>Agile testing must be iterative.
      </li>
      <li>Testers cannot rely on having complete specification.
      </li>
      <li>Agile testers must be flexible.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <strong>5) What are the Agile quality strategies?
    </strong><br>
    Agile quality strategies are:
    <br>
    <ul>
      <li>Re-factoring.
      </li>
      <li>Non-solo development.</li>
      <li>Static and dynamic code analysis
      </li>
      <li>Reviews and inspection
      </li>
      <ul>
        <li>Iteration/sprint demos
        </li>
        <li>All-hands demo
        </li>
        <li>Light-weight milestone reviews
        </li>
      </ul>
      <li>Short feedback cycles.
      </li>
      <li>Standards and guidelines.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <strong>6) Explain about the Agile process?
    </strong><br>
    The agile process follows the software development life cycle which includes
    requirements gathering, analysis, design, coding, testing and delivers
    partially implemented software and waits for the customer feedback. In the
    whole process, customer satisfaction is at highest priority with faster
    development time.
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong>7) What are the new features of agile process?</strong><br>
    &nbsp;In agile process new features can be added easily by using multiple
    iterations.
    <br>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Iterative</strong>: The main objective of agile software
        processes is satisfaction of customers, so it focuses on single
        requirement with multiple iterations.
      </li>
      <li><strong>Modularity
        </strong>Agile process decomposes the complete system into manageable
        pieces called modules. Modularity plays a major role in software
        development processes.
      </li>
      <li><strong>Time Boxing
        </strong>As agile process is iterative in nature, it requires the time
        limits on each module with respective cycle.
      </li>
      <li><strong>Parsimony
        </strong>In agile processes parsimony is required to mitigate risks and
        achieve the goals by minimal number of modules.
      </li>
      <li><strong>Incremental
        </strong>As the agile process is iterative in nature, it requires the
        system to be developed in increments, each increment is independent of
        others, and at last all increments are integrated into complete system.</li>
      <li><strong>Adaptive
        </strong>Due to the iterative nature of agile process new risks may
        occurs. The adaptive characteristic of agile process allows adapting the
        processes to attack the new risks and allows changes in the real time
        requirements.
      </li>
      <li><strong>Convergent
        </strong>All the risks associated with each increment are convergent in
        agile process by using iterative and incremental approach.
      </li>
      <li><strong>Collaborative
        </strong>As agile process is modular in nature, it needs a good
        communication among software development team.
        Different modules need to be integrated at the end of the software
        development process.
      </li>
      <li><strong>People Oriented</strong>
        In the agile processes customer satisfaction is the first priority over
        the technology and process. A good software development team increases
        the performance and productivity of the software.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <strong>8) Where the agile methods focus on?
    </strong><br>
    The agile methods are focused on different aspects of the software
    development life cycle. Some focus on the practices (extreme programming,
    pair programming), while others focus on managing the software projects (the
    scrum approach).
    <br>
    <strong><br>
      9) What are the benefits of Agile Modeling? </strong><br>
    <ul>
      <li>Agile methodology has an adaptive team which is able to respond to the
        changing requirements.
      </li>
      <li>The team does not have to invest time and effort and finally find that
        by the time they delivered the product, the requirement of the customer
        has changed.</li>
      <li>&nbsp;Face to face communication and continuous inputs from customer
        representative leaves no space for guesswork.
      </li>
      <li>The documentation is crisp and to the point to save time.
      </li>
      <li>The end result is the high quality software in least possible time
        duration and satisfied customer. </li>
    </ul>
