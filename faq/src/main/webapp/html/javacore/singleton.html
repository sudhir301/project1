<h2>Singleton</h2>
    <strong>What is Singleton? is it better to make whole method synchronized or
      only critical section synchronized ?</strong>
    <p>Singleton in Java is a class with just one instance in whole Java
      application, for example java.lang.Runtime is a Singleton class. Creating
      Singleton was tricky prior Java 4 but once Java 5 introduced Enum its very
      easy. see my article How to create thread-safe Singleton in Java for more
      details on writing Singleton using enum and double checked locking which
      is purpose of this Java interview question.</p>
    <p><strong>Can you write critical section code for singleton?</strong><br>
      This core Java question is followup of previous question and expecting
      candidate to write Java singleton using double checked locking. Remember
      to use volatile variable to make Singleton thread-safe. check 10 Interview
      questions on Singleton Pattern in Java for more details and questions
      answers</p>
    <p><strong>What is Singleton class? Have you used Singleton before?</strong></p>
    <p>Singleton is a class which has only one instance in whole application and
      provides a getInstance() method to access the singleton instance. There
      are many classes in JDK which is implemented using Singleton pattern like
      java.lang.Runtime which provides getRuntime() method to get access of it
      and used to get free memory and total memory in Java.</p>
    <p><strong>Which classes are candidates of Singleton? Which kind of class do
        you make Singleton in Java?</strong></p>
    <p>Here they check whether candidate has enough experience on usage of
      singleton or not. Does he is familiar of advantage/disadvantage or
      alternatives available for singleton in Java or not.</p>
    <p>Answer : Any class which you want to be available to whole application
      and whole only one instance is viable is candidate of becoming Singleton.
      One example of this is Runtime class , since on whole java application
      only one runtime environment can be possible making Runtime Singleton is
      right decision. Another example is a utility classes like Popup in GUI
      application, if you want to show popup with message you can have one PopUp
      class on whole GUI application and anytime just get its instance, and call
      show() with message.</p>
    <p><strong>Can you write code for getInstance() method of a Singleton class
        in Java?</strong></p>
    <p>Most of the java programmer fail here if they have mugged up the
      singleton code because you can ask lots of follow-up question based upon
      the code they have written. I have seen many programmer write Singleton
      getInstance() method with double checked locking but they are not really
      familiar with the caveat associated with double checking of singleton
      prior to Java 5.</p>
    <p>Answer : Until asked don?t write code using double checked locking as it
      is more complex and chances of errors are more but if you have deep
      knowledge of double checked locking, volatile variable and lazy loading
      than this is your chance to shine. I have shared code examples of writing
      singleton classes using enum, using static factory and with double checked
      locking in my recent post Why Enum Singletons are better in Java, please
      see there.</p>
    <p><strong>Is it better to make whole getInstance() method synchronized or
        just critical section is enough? Which one you will prefer?</strong></p>
    <p>This is really nice question and I mostly asked to just quickly check
      whether candidate is aware of performance trade off of unnecessary locking
      or not. Since locking only make sense when we need to create instance and
      rest of the time its just read only access so locking of critical section
      is always better option. read more about synchronization on How
      Synchronization works in Java<br>
      Answer : This is again related to double checked locking pattern, well
      synchronization is costly and when you apply this on whole method than
      call to getInstance() will be synchronized and contented. Since
      synchronization is only needed during initialization on singleton
      instance, to prevent creating another instance of Singleton, It?s better
      to only synchronize critical section and not whole method. Singleton
      pattern is also closely related to factory design pattern where
      getInstance() serves as static factory method.</p>
    <p><strong>What is lazy and early loading of Singleton and how will you
        implement it?</strong></p>
    <p>This is another great Singleton interview question in terms of
      understanding of concept of loading and cost associated with class loading
      in Java. Many of which I have interviewed not really familiar with this
      but its good to know concept.</p>
    <p>Answer : As there are many ways to implement Singleton like using double
      checked locking or Singleton class with static final instance initialized
      during class loading. Former is called lazy loading because Singleton
      instance is created only when client calls getInstance() method while
      later is called early loading because Singleton instance is created when
      class is loaded into memory.</p>
    <p><strong>Give me some examples of Singleton pattern from Java Development
        Kit?</strong></p>
    <p>This is open question to all, please share which classes are Singleton in
      JDK. Answer to this question is java.lang.Runtime<br>
      Answer : There are many classes in Java Development Kit which is written
      using singleton pattern, here are few of them:<br>
      Java.lang.Runtime with getRuntime() method<br>
      Java.awt.Toolkit with getDefaultToolkit()<br>
      Java.awt.Desktop with getDesktop()</p>
    <p><strong>What is double checked locking in Singleton?</strong></p>
    <p>One of the most hyped question on Singleton pattern and really demands
      complete understanding to get it right because of Java Memory model caveat
      prior to Java 5. If a guy comes up with a solution of using volatile
      keyword with Singleton instance and explains it then it really shows it
      has in depth knowledge of Java memory model and he is constantly updating
      his Java knowledge.</p>
    <p>Answer : Double checked locking is a technique to prevent creating
      another instance of Singleton when call to getInstance() method is made in
      multi-threading environment. In Double checked locking pattern as shown in
      below example, singleton instance is checked two times before
      initialization. See here to learn more about double-checked-locking in
      Java.</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">public static Singleton getInstance(){<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if(_INSTANCE == null){<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      synchronized(Singleton.class){<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; //double checked locking
      - because second check of Singleton instance with lock<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      if(_INSTANCE == null){<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      _INSTANCE = new Singleton();<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      }<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; return _INSTANCE;<br>
      }</p>
    <p>Double checked locking should only be used when you have requirement for
      lazy initialization otherwise use Enum to implement singleton or simple
      static final variable.</p>
    <p><strong>How do you prevent for creating another instance of Singleton
        using clone() method?</strong></p>
    <p>This type of questions generally comes some time by asking how to break
      singleton or when Singleton is not Singleton in Java.</p>
    <p>Answer : Preferred way is not to implement Cloneable interface as why
      should one wants to create clone() of Singleton and if you do just throw
      Exception from clone() method as ?Can not create clone of Singleton
      class?.</p>
    <p><strong>How do you prevent for creating another instance of Singleton
        using reflection?</strong></p>
    <p>Open to all. In my opinion throwing exception from constructor is an
      option.<br>
      Answer: This is similar to previous interview question. Since constructor
      of Singleton class is supposed to be private it prevents creating instance
      of Singleton from outside but Reflection can access private fields and
      methods, which opens a threat of another instance. This can be avoided by
      throwing Exception from constructor as ?Singleton already initialized?</p>
    <p><strong>How do you prevent for creating another instance of Singleton
        during serialization?</strong></p>
    <p>Another great question which requires knowledge of Serialization in Java
      and how to use it for persisting Singleton classes. This is open to you
      all but in my opinion use of readResolve() method can sort this out for
      you.<br>
      Answer: You can prevent this by using readResolve() method, since during
      serialization readObject() is used to create instance and it return new
      instance every time but by using readResolve you can replace it with
      original Singleton instance. I have shared code on how to do it in my post
      Enum as Singleton in Java. This is also one of the reason I have said that
      use Enum to create Singleton because serialization of enum is taken care
      by JVM and it provides guaranteed of that.</p>
    <p><strong>When is Singleton not a Singleton in Java?</strong></p>
    <p>There is a very good article present in Sun's Java site which discusses
      various scenarios when a Singleton is not really remains Singleton and
      multiple instance of Singleton is possible. Here is the link of that
      article
      http://java.sun.com/developer/technicalArticles/Programming/singletons/</p>
    <p><strong>Why you should avoid the singleton anti-pattern at all and
        replace it with DI?</strong></p>
    <p>Answer : Singleton Dependency Injection: every class that needs access to
      a singleton gets the object through its constructors or with a
      DI-container.</p>
    <p><strong>Why Singleton is Anti pattern</strong></p>
    <p>With more and more classes calling getInstance() the code gets more and
      more tightly coupled, monolithic, not testable and hard to change and hard
      to reuse because of not configurable, hidden dependencies. Also, there
      would be no need for this clumsy double checked locking if you call
      getInstance less often (i.e. once).</p>
    <p><strong>How many ways you can write Singleton Class in Java?</strong></p>
    <p>Answer : I know at least four ways to implement Singleton pattern in Java<br>
      Singleton by synchronizing getInstance() method<br>
      Singleton with public static final field initialized during class loading.<br>
      Singleton generated by static nested class, also referred as Singleton
      holder pattern.<br>
      From Java 5 on-wards using Enums</p>
    <p><strong>How to write thread-safe Singleton in Java?</strong></p>
    <p>Answer : Thread safe Singleton usually refers to write thread safe code
      which creates one and only one instance of Singleton if called by multiple
      thread at same time. There are many ways to achieve this like by using
      double checked locking technique as shown above and by using Enum or
      Singleton initialized by class loader.</p>
