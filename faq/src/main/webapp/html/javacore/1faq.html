    <h2 style="text-align: center;">JAVA CORE</h2>
    <h2>General Core</h2>
    <p><strong>What is the difference between factory and abstract factory
        pattern?</strong> </p>
    <p>Abstract Factory provides one more level of abstraction. Consider
      different factories each extended from an Abstract Factory and responsible
      for creation of different hierarchies of objects based on the type of
      factory. E.g. AbstractFactory extended by AutomobileFactory, UserFactory,
      RoleFactory etc. Each individual factory would be responsible for creation
      of objects in that genre.&nbsp; See here for detailed answer of this
      question.</p>
    <p><strong></strong></p>
    <h2>String &amp; Immutable Class</h2>
    <p><strong>What is Immutable Object? Can you write Immutable Class?</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Immutable classes are Java classes whose objects can not be modified
        once created.</li>
      <li>Any modification in Immutable object result in new object. For example
        String is immutable in Java.</li>
      <li>Mostly Immutable classes are also <strong>final in Java</strong>, in
        order<u> </u><strong>to prevent sub classes from overriding methods</strong>,
        which can compromise Immutability.</li>
      <li>You can achieve same functionality by making member as non final but
        private and not modifying them except in constructor.</li>
      <li>Apart form obvious, you also need to make sure that, you should not
        expose internals of Immutable object, especially if it contains a
        mutable member. Similarly, when you accept value for mutable member from
        client e.g. java.util.Date, use clone() method keep separate copy for
        yourself, to prevent risk of malicious client modifying mutable
        reference after setting it. Same precaution needs to be taken while
        returning value for a mutable member, return another separate copy to
        client, never return original reference held by Immutable class. You can
        see my post <a href="immutableClass.html">How to create Immutable class
          in Java for step by step guide and code examples.</a></li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Does all property of Immutable Object needs to be final?</strong></p>
    <p>Not necessary, as stated above you can achieve same functionality <strong>by
        making member as non final but private and not modifying them except in
        constructor</strong>. <strong>Don't provide setter method </strong>for
      them and if it is a<strong> mutable object, then don't ever leak any
        reference </strong>for that member. Remember making a reference
      variable final, only ensures that it will not be reassigned a different
      value, but you can still change individual properties of object, pointed
      by that reference variable. This is one of the key point, Interviewer like
      to hear from candidates. See my post on Java final variables, to learn
      more about them.</p>
    <p><strong>What is the difference between creating String as new() and
        literal?</strong></p>
    <p>When we create string with <strong>new() Operator</strong>, it?s <strong>created
        in heap </strong>and not added into string pool while <strong>String
        created using literal </strong>are created in <strong>String pool
        itself which exists in PermGen </strong>area of heap.<br>
      String str = new String("Test")</p>
    <p>does not put the object str in String pool , we need to call
      String.intern() method which is used to put them into String pool
      explicitly. its only when you create String object as String literal e.g.
      String s = "Test" Java automatically put that into String pool. By the way
      there is a catch here, Since we are passing arguments as "Test", which is
      a String literal, it will also create another object as "Test" on string
      pool. This is the one point, which has gone unnoticed, until knowledgeable
      readers of Javarevisited blog suggested it.&nbsp; <a href="stringLiteral.html">
        To learn more about difference between String literal and String object.</a></p>
    <p><strong>What is the difference when String is gets created using literal
        or new() operator?</strong><br>
      When we create string with new() operator, its created in heap only and
      not added into string pool, while String created using literal are created
      in String pool itself which exists in PermGen area of heap. You can put
      such string object into pool by calling intern() method. If you happen to
      create same String object multiple times, intern() can save some memory
      for you.</p>
    <p><strong>How does substring () inside String works?</strong></p>
    <p>Substring creates new object out of source string by taking a portion of
      original string?. This question was mainly asked to see if developer is
      familiar with risk of memory leak, which sub-string can create. Until Java
      1.7, substring holds reference of original character array, which means
      even a substring of 5 character long, can prevent 1GB character array from
      garbage collection, by holding a strong reference. This issue is fixed in
      Java 1.7, where original character array is not referenced any more, but
      that change also made creation of substring bit costly in terms of time.
      Earlier it was on the range of O(1), which could be O(n) in worst case on
      Java 7. See my post How SubString works in Java for detailed answer of
      this Java question.</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><strong>how do you deal with this problem</strong>?
      Though you can not go, and change Java substring method, you can still
      make some work around, in case you are creating substring of significant
      longer String. Simple solution is to<strong> trim the string, and keep
        size of character array according to length of substring.</strong>
      Luckily java.lang.String has constructor to do this, as shown in below
      example.</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">// comma separated stock symbols from NYSE<br>
      String listOfStockSymbolsOnNYSE = getStockSymbolsForNYSE();</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">//calling String(string) constructor<br>
      String apple = new String(<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      listOfStockSymbolsOnNYSE.substring(appleStartIndex, appleEndIndex)<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      );</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">If you look code on java.lang.String class,
      you will see that this constructor trim the array, if it?s bigger than
      String itself.</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">public String(String original) {<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ...</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if
      (originalValue.length &gt; size) {<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; // The
      array representing the String is bigger than the new<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; //
      String itself.&nbsp; Perhaps this constructor is being called<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; // in
      order to trim the baggage, so make a copy of the array.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; int off
      = original.offset;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; v =
      Arrays.copyOfRange(originalValue, off, off+size);</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }
      else {</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      // The array representing the String is the same<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; // size
      as the String, so no point in making a copy.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; v =
      originalValue;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ...<br>
      &nbsp;}<br>
      Another way to solve this problem is to call intern() method on substring,
      which will than fetch an existing string from pool or add it if necessary.
      Since the String in the pool is a real string it only take space as much
      it requires. It?s also worth noting that sub-strings are not internalized,
      when you call intern() method on original String. Most developer
      successfully answers first three questions, which is related to usage of
      substring, but they get stuck on last two, How substring creates memory
      leak or How substring works. It's not completely there fault, because what
      you know is that every time substring() returns new String which is not
      exactly true, since it?s backed by same character array.</p>

      </strong></h2>
    <p><strong>Which two method you need to implement to use an Object as key in
        HashMap?</strong></p>
    <p>In order to use any object as Key in HashMap or Hashtable, it must<strong>
        implements equals and ha</strong>shcode method in Java. Read How HashMap
      works in Java for detailed explanation on how equals and hashcode method
      is used to put and get object from HashMap. You can also see my post <a href="equalsAndHashCode.html">
        5 tips to correctly override equals in Java</a> to learn more about
      equals.</p>
    <p><strong>Where does equals and hashcode method comes in picture during get
        operation?</strong></p>
    <p>This core Java interview question is follow-up of previous Java question
      and candidate should know that once you mention hashCode, people are most
      likely ask, how they are used in HashMap. When you provide key object,
      first it's hashcode method is called to calculate bucket location. Since a
      bucket may contain more than one entry as linked list, each of those
      Map.Entry object are evaluated by using equals() method to see if they
      contain the actual key object or not. See How get method of HashMap works
      in Java for detailed explanation.</p>
    <p><br>
      <strong>Can you write code for iterating over HashMap in Java 4 and Java 5
        ?</strong><br>
      Tricky one but he managed to write using while and for loop. Actually
      there are four ways to iterate over any Map in Java, one involves using
      keySet() and iterating over key and then using get() method to retrieve
      values, which is bit expensive. Second method involves using entrySet()
      and iterating over them either by using foreach loop or while with
      Iterator.hasNext() method. This one is better approach because both key
      and value object are available to you during Iteration and you don't need
      to call get() method for retrieving value, which could give O(n)
      performance in case of huge linked list at one bucket. See my post 4 ways
      to iterate over Map in Java for detailed explanation and code examples.</p>
    <p><strong>When do you override hashcode() and equals() ?</strong><br>
      Whenever necessary especially if you want to do equality check based upon
      business logic rather than object equality e.g. two employee object are
      equal if they have same emp_id, despite the fact that they are two
      different object, created by different part of code. Also overriding both
      these methods are must if you want to use them as key in HashMap. Now as
      part of equals-hashcode contract in Java, when you override equals, you
      must override hashcode as well, otherwise your object will not break
      invariant of classes e.g. Set, Map which relies on equals() method for
      functioning properly. You can also check my post 5 tips on equals in Java
      to understand subtle issue which can arise while dealing with these two
      methods.</p>
    <p><strong>What will be the problem if you don't override hashcode() method
        ?</strong><br>
      If you don't override equals method, than contract between equals and
      hashcode will not work, according to which, two object which are equal by
      equals() must have same hashcode. In this case other object may return
      different hashcode and will be stored on that location, which breaks
      invariant of HashMap class, because they are not supposed to allow
      duplicate keys. When you add object using put() method, it iterate through
      all Map.Entry object present in that bucket location, and update value of
      previous mapping, if Map already contains that key. This will not work if
      hashcode is not overridden. You can also see my post on tips to override
      hashcode in Java for more details.</p>
    <p><strong>Is it better to synchronize critical section of getInstance()
        method or whole getInstance() method?</strong><br>
      Answer is only critical section, because if we lock whole method than
      every time some some one call this method, it will have to wait even
      though we are not creating any object. In other words, synchronization is
      only needed, when you create object, which happens only once. Once object
      has created, there is no need for any synchronization. In fact, that's
      very poor coding in terms of performance, as synchronized method reduce
      performance upto 10 to 20 times. By the way, there are several ways to
      create thread-safe singleton in Java, which you can also mention as part
      of this question or any follow-up.</p>
    <strong>Does not overriding hashcode() method has any performance
      implication ?</strong><br>
    <p> This is a good question and open to all , as per my knowledge a poor
      hashcode function will result in frequent collision in HashMap which
      eventually increase time for adding an object into Hash Map.</p>
    <p><strong>What?s wrong using HashMap in multithreaded environment? When
        get() method go to infinite loop?</strong><br>
      Well nothing is wrong, it depending upon how you use. For example if you
      initialize the HashMap just by one thread and then all threads are only
      reading from it, then it's perfectly fine. One example of this is a Map
      which contains configuration properties. Real problem starts when at-least
      one of those thread is updating HashMap i.e. adding, changing or removing
      any key value pair. Since put() operation can cause re-sizing and which
      can further lead to infinite loop, that's why either you should use
      Hashtable or ConcurrentHashMap, later is better.</p>
    <p>Give a simplest way to find out the time a method takes for execution
      without using any profiling tool?<br>
      this questions is suggested by @Mohit<br>
      Read the system time just before the method is invoked and immediately
      after method returns. Take the time difference, which will give you the
      time taken by a method for execution.</p>
    <p>To put it in code?</p>
    <p>long start = System.currentTimeMillis ();<br>
      method ();<br>
      long end = System.currentTimeMillis ();</p>
    <p>System.out.println (?Time taken for execution is ? + (end ? start));</p>
    <p>Remember that if the time taken for execution is too small, it might show
      that it is taking zero milliseconds for execution. Try it on a method
      which is big enough, in the sense the one which is doing considerable
      amount of processing</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Question 20. How would you prevent a client from directly instantiating
      your concrete classes? For example, you have a Cache interface and two
      implementation classes MemoryCache and DiskCache, How do you ensure there
      is no object of this two classes is created by client using new() keyword.<br>
      I leave this question for you to practice and think about, before I give
      answer. I am sure you can figure out right way to do this, as this is one
      of the important decision to keep control of classes in your hand, great
      from maintenance perspective.</p>

      I am also very grateful to my readers who have generously contributed
      several good questions from Java Interviews for both beginners and
      experienced developers alike. I have already answered many of these

      Core Java Interview Questions and Answers</p>
    <p><strong><br>
        Difference between ArrayList and linked list? </strong></p>
    <p>When to use ArrayList vs LinkdedList </p>
    <p>Before comparing differences of ArrayList and LinkedList, let's see What
      is common between ArrayList and LinkedList in Java : </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Both ArrayList and LinkedList are implementation of List interface,
        which means you can pass either ArrayList or LinkedList if a method
        accepts List interface.</li>
      <li>Both ArrayList and LinkedList are not synchronized, which means you
        can not shared them between multiple threads without external
        synchronization. See here to know How to make ArrayList synchronized in
        Java.&nbsp;</li>
      <li>ArrayList and LinkedList are ordered collection e.g. they maintain
        insertion order of elements i.e. first element will be added on first
        position. </li>
      <li>ArrayList and LinkedList also allows duplicates and null unlike any
        other List implementation e.g. Vector.&nbsp;</li>
      <li>Iterator of both LinkedList and ArrayList are fail-fast which means
        they will throw ConcurrentModificationException if collection is
        modified structurally once Iterator is created. They are different than
        CopyOnWriteArrayList whose Iterator is fail-safe. </li>
    </ol>
    <p>Now let's see some difference between ArrayList and LinkedList and When
      to use ArrayList and LinkedList in Java. </p>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Data Structure</strong> First difference between ArrayList and
        LinkedList comes with the fact that ArrayList is backed by Array while
        LinkedList is backed by LinkedList. This will lead further differences
        in performance. </li>
      <li><strong>LinkedList implements Deque</strong> Another difference
        between ArrayList and LinkedList is that apart from List interface,
        LinkedList also implements Deque interface, which provides first in
        first out operations for add() and poll() and several other Deque
        functions. Also LinkedList is implemented as doubly linked list and for
        index based operation navigation can happen from either end. </li>
      <li><strong>Adding element in ArrayList</strong> Adding element in
        ArrayList is O(1) operation if it doesn't trigger re-size of Array, in
        which case it becomes O(log(n)) , On the other hand appending an element
        in LinkedList is O(1) operation, as it doesn't required any navigation.
      </li>
      <li><strong>Removing element from a position</strong> In order to remove
        an element from a particular index e.g. by calling remove(index),
        ArrayList performs a copy operation which makes it close to O(n) while
        LinkedList needs to traverse to that point which also makes it O(n/2),
        as it can traverse from either direction based upon proximity. </li>
      <li>Iterating over ArrayList or LinkedList Iteration is O(n) operation for
        both LinkedList and ArrayList where n is number of element. </li>
      <li>Getting element from a position get(index) operation is O(1) in
        ArrayList while its O(n/2) in LinkedList, as it needs to traverse till
        that entry. </li>
      <li>Memory LinkedList uses a wrapper object, Entry, which is a static
        nested class for storing data and two nodes next and previous while
        ArrayList just store data in Array. So memory requirement seems less in
        case of ArrayList than LinkedList except the case where Array performs
        re-size operation, when it copies content from one Array to another. If
        Array is large enough it may take lot of memory at that point and
        trigger Garbage collection, which can slow response time. </li>
    </ol>
    <p>From all the above differences between ArrayList vs LinkedList, It looks
      ArrayList is better choice than LinkedList in almost all cases, except
      when you do a frequent add() operation than remove() or get(). In my
      opinion use ArrayList over LinkedList for most of practical purpose. Read

    <p>This is one from our Anonymous reader but useful to people going for
      interview on Investment Banks<br>
      Some exercises for an interview that I had with Morgan Stanley(in 2014):</p>
    <p>1. Explain what 'path to root' means in the context of garbage
      collection. What are roots?<br>
      2. Write code for a simple implementation of HashMap/Hashtable<br>
      3. Write a short program to illustrate the concept of deadlock<br>
      4. Explain why recursive implementation of QuickSort will require O(log n)
      of additional space<br>
      5. Explain the design pattern used in Java and .NET io stream/reader APIs.<br>
      6. Create an Iterator filtering framework: an IObjectTest interface with a
      single boolean test(Object o) method and an Iterator sub-class which is
      initialized with another Iterator and an IObjectTest instance. Your
      iterator will then allow iteration over the original, but skipping any
      objects which don't pass the test. Create a simple unit test for this
      framework.</p>
    <p><strong>How do you handle error condition while writing stored procedure
        or accessing stored procedure from java?</strong></p>
    <p>This is one of the tough Java interview question and its open for all, my
      friend didn't know the answer so he didn't mind telling me. My take is
      that stored procedure should return error code if some operation fails but
      if stored procedure itself fail than catching SQLException is only choice.</p>

    <h2>GENERICS</h2>
    <p><strong>Why Use Generics?</strong></p>
    <p>Code that uses generics has many benefits over non-generic code:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Stronger type checks at compile time.</li>
    </ul>
    <p style="margin-left: 80px;">A Java compiler applies strong type checking
      to generic code and issues errors if the code violates type safety. Fixing
      compile-time errors is easier than fixing runtime errors, which can be
      difficult to find.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Elimination of casts.</li>
    </ul>
    <p style="margin-left: 80px;">The following code snippet without generics
      requires casting:<br>
      <em>List list = new ArrayList();<br>
        list.add("hello");<br>
        String s = (String) list.get(0);</em></p>
    <p style="margin-left: 80px;"><br>
      When re-written to use generics, the code does not require casting:<br>
      <em>List<string> list = new ArrayList<string>();<br>
            list.add("hello");<br>
            String s = list.get(0);&nbsp;&nbsp; // no cast</string></string></em></p>
    <ul>
      <li><em>Enabli</em>ng programmers to implement generic algorithms.</li>
    </ul>
    <p style="margin-left: 80px;">By using generics, programmers can implement
      generic algorithms that work on collections of different types, can be
      customized, and are type safe and easier to read</p>
    <p>Type Parameter Naming Conventions</p>
    <p>The most commonly used type parameter names are:</p>
    <p>E - Element (used extensively by the Java Collections Framework)<br>
      K - Key<br>
      N - Number<br>
      T - Type<br>
      V - Value<br>
      S,U,V etc. - 2nd, 3rd, 4th types</p>
    <p><strong>Raw Types</strong></p>
    <p>A raw type is the name of a generic class or interface without any type
      arguments. For example, given the generic Box class:</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">public class Box<t> {<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; public void set(T t) { /* ... */ }<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; // ...<br>
        }</t></p>
    <p>To create a parameterized type of Box<t>, you supply an actual type
        argument for the formal type parameter T:</t></p>
    <p>Box<integer> intBox = new Box&lt;&gt;();<br>
        If the actual type argument is omitted, you create a raw type of Box<t>:</t></integer></p>
    <p>Box rawBox = new Box();</p>
    <p><strong>Bounded Type Parameters</strong></p>
    <p>There may be times when you want to restrict the types that can be used
      as type arguments in a parameterized type. For example, a method that
      operates on numbers might only want to accept instances of Number or its
      subclasses. This is what bounded type parameters are for.</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">&nbsp; &nbsp; public <u extends="" number="">
        void inspect(U u){<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; System.out.println("T: " +
        t.getClass().getName());<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; System.out.println("U: " +
        u.getClass().getName());<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }</u></p>
    <p><u extends="" number="">Multiple Bounds&nbsp; <t b1="" b2="" b3="" extends=""></t></u></p>
    <p><u extends="" number="">&nbsp;</u></p>
