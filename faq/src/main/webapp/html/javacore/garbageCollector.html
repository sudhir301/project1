    <p><strong>Exploring the JVM Architecture</strong></p>
    <p><strong>Hotspot Architecture</strong></p>
    <p>The HotSpot JVM possesses an architecture that supports a strong
      foundation of features and capabilities and supports the ability to
      realize high performance and massive scalability. For example, the HotSpot
      JVM JIT compilers generate dynamic optimizations. In other words, they
      make optimization decisions while the Java application is running and
      generate high-performing native machine instructions targeted for the
      underlying system architecture. In addition, through the maturing
      evolution and continuous engineering of its runtime environment and
      multithreaded garbage collector, the HotSpot JVM yields high scalability
      on even the largest available computer systems.</p>
    <p><img src="../../img/Slide1.PNG" width="500"></p>
    <p>The main components of the JVM include the classloader, the runtime data
      areas, and the execution engine.</p>
    <p><strong>Key Hotspot Components</strong></p>
    <p>The key components of the JVM that relate to performance are highlighted
      in the following image.</p>
    <p><img src="../../img/Slide2.PNG" width="500"></p>
    <p>There are three components of the JVM that are focused on when tuning
      performance. The heap is where your object data is stored. This area is
      then managed by the garbage collector selected at startup. Most tuning
      options relate to sizing the heap and choosing the most appropriate
      garbage collector for your situation. The JIT compiler also has a big
      impact on performance but rarely requires tuning with the newer versions
      of the JVM.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;<br>
      <strong>Performance Basics</strong><br>
      Typically, when tuning a Java application, the focus is on one of two main
      goals: responsiveness or throughput. We will refer back to these concepts
      as the tutorial progresses.</p>
    <p><strong>Responsiveness</strong></p>
    <p>Responsiveness refers to how quickly an application or system responds
      with a requested piece of data. Examples include:</p>
    <p>How quickly a desktop UI responds to an event<br>
      How fast a website returns a page<br>
      How fast a database query is returned<br>
      For applications that focus on respsonsiveness, large pause times are not
      acceptable. The focus is on responding in short periods of time.</p>
    <p><strong>Throughput</strong></p>
    <p>Throughput focuses on maximizing the amount of work by an application in
      a specific period of time. Examples of how throughput might be measured
      include:</p>
    <p>The number of transactions completed in a given time.<br>
      The number of jobs that a batch program can complete in an hour.<br>
      The number of database queries that can be completed in an hour.<br>
      High pause times are acceptable for applications that focus on throughput.
      Since high throughput applications focus on benchmarks over longer periods
      of time, quick response time is not a consideration.</p>
    <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
    <p><strong>Describing Garbage Collection</strong><br>
      <strong>What is Automatic Garbage Collection?</strong></p>
    <p>Automatic garbage collection is the process of looking at heap memory,
      identifying which objects are in use and which are not, and deleting the
      unused objects. An in use object, or a referenced object, means that some
      part of your program still maintains a pointer to that object. An unused
      object, or unreferenced object, is no longer referenced by any part of
      your program. So the memory used by an unreferenced object can be
      reclaimed.</p>
    <p>In a programming language like C, allocating and deallocating memory is a
      manual process. In Java, process of deallocating memory is handled
      automatically by the garbage collector. The basic process can be described
      as follows.</p>
    <p><strong>Step 1: Marking</strong></p>
    <p>The first step in the process is called marking. This is where the
      garbage collector identifies which pieces of memory are in use and which
      are not.</p>
    <p><img src="../../img/Slide3.PNG" width="500"></p>
    <p>Referenced objects are shown in blue. Unreferenced objects are shown in
      gold. All objects are scanned in the marking phase to make this
      determination. This can be a very time consuming process if all objects in
      a system must be scanned.</p>
    <p><strong>Step 2: Normal Deletion</strong></p>
    <p>Normal deletion removes unreferenced objects leaving referenced objects
      and pointers to free space.</p>
    <p><img src="../../img/Slide1b.PNG" width="500"></p>
    <p>The memory allocator holds references to blocks of free space where new
      object can be allocated.</p>
    <p><strong>Step 2a: Deletion with Compacting</strong></p>
    <p>To further improve performance, in addition to deleting unreferenced
      objects, you can also compact the remaining referenced objects. By moving
      referenced object together, this makes new memory allocation much easier
      and faster.</p>
    <p><img src="../../img/Slide4.PNG" width="500"></p>
    <p><strong>Why Generational Garbage Collection?</strong></p>
    <p>As stated earlier, having to mark and compact all the objects in a JVM is
      inefficient. As more and more objects are allocated, the list of objects
      grows and grows leading to longer and longer garbage collection time.
      However, empirical analysis of applications has shown that most objects
      are short lived.</p>
    <p>Here is an example of such data. The Y axis shows the number of bytes
      allocated and the X access shows the number of bytes allocated over time.</p>
    <p><img src="../../img/ObjectLifetime.gif" width="500"></p>
    <p>As you can see, fewer and fewer objects remain allocated over time. In
      fact most objects have a very short life as shown by the higher values on
      the left side of the graph.</p>
    <p><strong>JVM Generations</strong></p>
    <p>The information learned from the object allocation behavior can be used
      to enhance the performance of the JVM. Therefore, the heap is broken up
      into smaller parts or generations. The heap parts are: Young Generation,
      Old or Tenured Generation, and Permanent Generation</p>
    <p><img src="../../img/Slide5.PNG" width="500"></p>
    <p>The <strong>Young Generation </strong>is where all new objects are
      allocated and aged. When the young generation fills up, this causes a
      minor garbage collection. Minor collections can be optimized assuming a
      high object mortality rate. A young generation full of dead objects is
      collected very quickly. Some surviving objects are aged and eventually
      move to the old generation.</p>
    <p><strong>Stop the World Event </strong>- All minor garbage collections
      are "Stop the World" events. This means that all application threads are
      stopped until the operation completes. Minor garbage collections are
      always Stop the World events.</p>
    <p>The <strong>Old Generation</strong> is used to store long surviving
      objects. Typically, a threshold is set for young generation object and
      when that age is met, the object gets moved to the old generation.
      Eventually the old generation needs to be collected. This event is called
      a <strong>major garbage collection.</strong></p>
    <p>Major garbage collection are also Stop the World events. Often a major
      collection is much slower because it involves all live objects. So for
      Responsive applications, major garbage collections should be minimized.
      Also note, that the length of the Stop the World event for a major garbage
      collection is affected by the kind of garbage collector that is used for
      the old generation space.</p>
    <p>The <strong>Permanent generation </strong>contains metadata required by
      the JVM to describe the classes and methods used in the application. The
      permanent generation is populated by the JVM at runtime based on classes
      in use by the application. In addition, Java SE library classes and
      methods may be stored here.</p>
    <p>Classes may get collected (unloaded) if the JVM finds they are no longer
      needed and space may be needed for other classes. The permanent generation
      is included in a full garbage collection.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;<br>
      <strong>The Generational Garbage Collection Process</strong><br>
      Now that you understand why the heap is separted into different
      generations, it is time to look at how exactly these spaces interact. The
      pictures that follow walks through the object allocation and aging process
      in the JVM.</p>
    <p>First, any new objects are allocated to the eden space. Both survivor
      spaces start out empty.</p>
    <p><img src="../../img/Slide13.PNG" width="500"></p>
    <p>When the eden space fills up, a minor garbage collection is triggered.</p>
    <p><img src="../../img/Slide14.PNG" width="500"></p>
    <p>Referenced objects are moved to the first survivor space. Unreferenced
      objects are deleted when the eden space is cleared.</p>
    <p><img src="../../img/Slide6.PNG" width="500"></p>
    <p>At the next minor GC, the same thing happens for the eden space.
      Unreferenced objects are deleted and referenced objects are moved to a
      survivor space. However, in this case, they are moved to the second
      survivor space (S1). In addition, objects from the last minor GC on the
      first survivor space (S0) have their age incremented and get moved to S1.
      Once all surviving objects have been moved to S1, both S0 and eden are
      cleared. Notice we now have differently aged object in the survivor space.</p>
    <p><img src="../../img/Slide8.PNG" width="500"></p>
    <p>At the next minor GC, the same process repeats. However this time the
      survivor spaces switch. Referenced objects are moved to S0. Surviving
      objects are aged. Eden and S1 are cleared.</p>
    <p><img src="../../img/Slide9.PNG" width="500"></p>
    <p>This slide demonstrates promotion. After a minor GC, when aged objects
      reach a certain age threshold (8 in this example) they are promoted from
      young generation to old generation.</p>
    <p><img src="../../img/Slide7.PNG" width="500"></p>
    <p>As minor GCs continue to occure objects will continue to be promoted to
      the old generation space.</p>
    <p><img src="../../img/Slide10.PNG" width="500"></p>
    <p>So that pretty much covers the entire process with the young generation.
      Eventually, a major GC will be performed on the old generation which
      cleans up and compacts that space. <img src="../../img/Slide11.PNG" width="500"></p>
    <p><strong>Java Garbage Collectors</strong></p>
    <p>You now know the basics of garbage collection and have observed the
      garbage collector in action on a sample application. In this section, you
      will learn about the garbage collectors available for Java and the command
      line switches you need to select them.</p>
    <p><strong>Common Heap Related Switches</strong></p>
    <p>There are many different command line switches that can be used with
      Java. This section describes some of the more commonly used switches that
      are also used in this OBE.</p>
    <p><strong>Switch&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Description</strong><br>
      -Xms&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sets
      the initial heap size for when the JVM starts.<br>
      -Xmx&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      Sets the maximum heap size.<br>
      -Xmn&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      Sets the size of the Young Generation.<br>
      -XX:PermSize&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sets the
      starting size of the Permanent Generation.<br>
      -XX:MaxPermSize&nbsp; Sets the maximum size of the Permanent Generation</p>
    <p><strong>The Serial GC</strong></p>
    <p>The serial collector is the default for client style machines in Java SE
      5 and 6. With the serial collector, both minor and major garbage
      collections are done serially (using a single virtual CPU). In addition,
      it uses a mark-compact collection method. This method moves older memory
      to the beginning of the heap so that new memory allocations are made into
      a single continuous chunk of memory at the end of the heap. This
      compacting of memory makes it faster to allocate new chunks of memory to
      the heap.</p>
    <p><strong>Usage Cases</strong></p>
    <p>The Serial GC is the garbage collector of choice for most applications
      that do not have low pause time requirements and run on client-style
      machines. It takes advantage of only a single virtual processor for
      garbage collection work (therefore, its name). Still, on today's hardware,
      the Serial GC can efficiently manage a lot of non-trivial applications
      with a few hundred MBs of Java heap, with relatively short worst-case
      pauses (around a couple of seconds for full garbage collections).</p>
    <p>Another popular use for the Serial GC is in environments where a high
      number of JVMs are run on the same machine (in some cases, more JVMs than
      available processors!). In such environments when a JVM does a garbage
      collection it is better to use only one processor to minimize the
      interference on the remaining JVMs, even if the garbage collection might
      last longer. And the Serial GC fits this trade-off nicely.</p>
    <p>Finally, with the proliferation of embedded hardware with minimal memory
      and few cores, the Serial GC could make a comeback.</p>
    <p><strong>Command Line Switches</strong></p>
    <p>To enable the Serial Collector use:<br>
      -XX:+UseSerialGC</p>
    <p>Here is a sample command line for starting the Java2Demo:<br>
      java -Xmx12m -Xms3m -Xmn1m -XX:PermSize=20m -XX:MaxPermSize=20m
      -XX:+UseSerialGC -jar c:\javademos\demo\jfc\Java2D\Java2demo.jar</p>
    <p><strong>The Parallel GC</strong></p>
    <p>The parallel garbage collector uses multiple threads to perform the young
      genertion garbage collection. By default on a host with N CPUs, the
      parallel garbage collector uses N garbage collector threads in the
      collection. The number of garbage collector threads can be controlled with
      command-line options:<br>
      -XX:ParallelGCThreads=&lt;desired number&gt;</p>
    <p>On a host with a single CPU the default garbage collector is used even if
      the parallel garbage collector has been requested. On a host with two CPUs
      the parallel garbage collector generally performs as well as the default
      garbage collector and a reduction in the young generationgarbage collector
      pause times can be expected on hosts with more than two CPUs. The Parallel
      GC comes in two flavors.</p>
    <p><strong>Usage Cases</strong></p>
    <p>The Parallel collector is also called a throughput collector. Since it
      can use multilple CPUs to speed up application throughput. This collector
      should be used when a lot of work need to be done and long pauses are
      acceptable. For example, batch processing like printing reports or bills
      or performing a large number of database queries.</p>
    <p><strong>-XX:+UseParallelGC</strong></p>
    <p>With this command line option you get a multi-thread young generation
      collector with a single-threaded old generation collector. The option also
      does single-threaded compaction of old generation.</p>
    <p>Here is a sample command line for starting the Java2Demo:<br>
      java -Xmx12m -Xms3m -Xmn1m -XX:PermSize=20m -XX:MaxPermSize=20m
      -XX:+UseParallelGC -jar c:\javademos\demo\jfc\Java2D\Java2demo.jar</p>
    <p><strong>-XX:+UseParallelOldGC</strong></p>
    <p>With the -XX:+UseParallelOldGC option, the GC is both a multithreaded
      young generation collector and multithreaded old generation collector. It
      is also a multithreaded compacting collector. HotSpot does compaction only
      in the old generation. Young generation in HotSpot is considered a copy
      collector; therefore, there is no need for compaction.</p>
    <p>Compacting describes the act of moving objects in a way that there are no
      holes between objects. After a garbage collection sweep, there may be
      holes left between live objects. Compacting moves objects so that there
      are no remaining holes. It is possible that a garbage collector be a
      non-compacting collector. Therefore, the difference between a parallel
      collector and a parallel compacting collector could be the latter compacts
      the space after a garbage collection sweep. The former would not.</p>
    <p>Here is a sample command line for starting the Java2Demo:<br>
      java -Xmx12m -Xms3m -Xmn1m -XX:PermSize=20m -XX:MaxPermSize=20m
      -XX:+UseParallelOldGC -jar c:\javademos\demo\jfc\Java2D\Java2demo.jar</p>
    <p><strong>The Concurrent Mark Sweep (CMS) Collector</strong></p>
    <p>The Concurrent Mark Sweep (CMS) collector (also referred to as the
      concurrent low pause collector) collects the tenured generation. It
      attempts to minimize the pauses due to garbage collection by doing most of
      the garbage collection work concurrently with the application threads.
      Normally the concurrent low pause collector does not copy or compact the
      live objects. A garbage collection is done without moving the live
      objects. If fragmentation becomes a problem, allocate a larger heap.</p>
    <p>Note: CMS collector on young generation uses the same algorithm as that
      of the parallel collector.</p>
    <p><strong>Usage Cases</strong></p>
    <p>The CMS collector should be used for applications that require low pause
      times and can share resources with the garbage collector. Examples include
      desktop UI application that respond to events, a webserver responding to a
      request or a database responding to queries.</p>
    <p><strong>Command Line Switches</strong></p>
    <p>To enable the CMS Collector use:<br>
      -XX:+UseConcMarkSweepGC<br>
      and to set the number of threads use:<br>
      -XX:ParallelCMSThreads=&lt;n&gt;</p>
    <p>Here is a sample command line for starting the Java2Demo:<br>
      java -Xmx12m -Xms3m -Xmn1m -XX:PermSize=20m -XX:MaxPermSize=20m
      -XX:+UseConcMarkSweepGC -XX:ParallelCMSThreads=2 -jar
      c:\javademos\demo\jfc\Java2D\Java2demo.jar</p>
    <p><strong>The G1 Garbage Collector</strong></p>
    <p>The Garbage First or G1 garbage collector is available in Java 7 and is
      designed to be the long term replacement for the CMS collector. The G1
      collector is a parallel, concurrent, and incrementally compacting
      low-pause garbage collector that has quite a different layout from the
      other garbage collectors described previously. However, detailed
      discussion is beyond the scope of this OBE.</p>
    <p>Command Line Switches</p>
    <p>To enable the G1 Collector use:<br>
      -XX:+UseG1GC</p>
    <p>Here is a sample command line for starting the Java2Demo:<br>
      java -Xmx12m -Xms3m -XX:+UseG1GC -jar
      c:\javademos\demo\jfc\Java2D\Java2demo.jar</p>
    FAQ's<br>
    <strong>Question 1 - What is structure of Java Heap ? What is Perm Gen space
      in Heap ?</strong> <br>
    Answer : Heap is divided into different generation e.g. new generation, old
    generation and PermGen space.PermGen space is used to store class's metadata
    and filling of PermGen space can cause <em>java.lang.OutOfMemory:PermGen</em>
    space. Its also worth noting to remember JVM option to configure PermGen
    space in Java. <br>
    <br>
    <strong>Question 2 - How do you identify minor and major garbage collection
      in Java?</strong> <br>
    Answer: Minor collection prints "GC"&#157; if garbage collection logging is
    enable using -verbose:gc or -XX:PrintGCDetails, while Major collection
    prints "Full GC"&#157;. This Garbage collection interview question is based on
    understanding of Garbage collection output. As more and more Interviewer are
    asking question to check candidate's ability to understand GC output, this
    topic become even more important. <br>
    <br>
    <strong>Question 3 - What is difference between ParNew and DefNew Young
      Generation Garbage collector? </strong><br>
    Answer : This Garbage Collection interview questions is recently asked to
    one of my friend. It require more than average knowledge on GC to answer
    this question. By the way ParNew and DefNew is two young generation garbage
    collector. ParNew is a multi-threaded GC used along with concurrent Mark
    Sweep while DefNew is single threaded GC used along with Serial Garbage
    Collector. <br>
    <br>
    <strong>Question 4 - How do you find GC resulted due to calling System.gc()?
    </strong><br>
    Answer : Another GC interview question which is based on GC output. Similar
    to major and minor collection, there will be a word "System"&#157; included in
    Garbage collection output. <br>
    <strong><br>
      Question 5 - What is difference between Serial and Throughput Garbage
      collector? </strong><br>
    Answer : Serial Garbage collector is a stop the world GC which stops
    application thread from running during both minor and major collection.
    Serial Garbage collector can be enabled using JVM option -XX:UseSerialGC and
    it's designed for Java application which doesn't have pause time requirement
    and have client configuration. <strong>Serial Garbage collector </strong>was
    also default GC in JDK 1.4 before ergonomics was introduced in JDK 1.5.
    Serial GC is most suited for small application with less number of thread
    while throughput GG is more suited for large applications. <br>
    <br>
    On the other hand Throughput garbage collector is parallel collector where
    minor and major collection happens in parallel taking full advantage of all
    the system resources available like multiple processor. Though both major
    and minor collection runs on stop-the-world fashion and introduced pause in
    application. Throughput Garbage collector can be enable using
    -XX:UseParallelGC or -XX:UseOldParallelGC. It increases overall throughput
    of application my minimizing time spent in Garbage collection but still has
    long pauses during full GC.This is a kind of Garbage collection interview
    questions which gives you an opportunity to show your knowledge in detail
    while answering. I always suggest to answer these kind of questions in
    detail. <br>
    <br>
    <strong>Question 6 - When does an Object becomes eligible for Garbage
      collection in Java ? </strong><br>
    Answer : An object becomes eligible for garbage collection when there is no
    live reference for that object or it can not be reached by any live thread.
    Cyclic reference doesn't count as live reference and if two objects are
    pointing to each other and there is no live reference for any of them, than
    both are eligible for GC. Also Garbage collection thread is a daemon thread
    which will run by JVM based upon GC algorithm and when runs it collects all
    objects which are eligible for GC. <br>
    <br>
    <strong>Question 7 - What is finalize method in Java ? When does Garbage
      collector calls finalize method in Java ? <br>
    </strong>Answer : Finalize method in Java also called finalizer is a method
    defined in java.lang.Object and called by Garbage collector before
    collecting any object which is eligible for GC. Finalize() method provides
    last chance to object to do cleanup and free any remaining resource, to
    learn more about finalizers, read What is finalize method in Java. <br>
    <br>
    <strong>Question 8 - If Object A has reference to Object B and Object B
      refer to Object A, apart from that there is no live reference to either
      object A or B, Does they are eligible to Garbage collection ? <br>
    </strong>This Garbage collection interview questions is related question 5
    "When object become eligible for Garbage collection"&#157;. An object becomes
    eligible for Garbage collection if there is no live reference for it. It can
    not be accessible from any Thread and cyclic dependency doesn't prevent
    Object from being Garbage collected. Which means in this case both Object A
    and Object B are eligible of Garbage collection. See How Garbage collection
    works in Java for more details. <br>
    <br>
    <strong>Question 9 -Can we force Garbage collector to run at any time ? </strong><br>
    Answer : No, you can not force Garbage collection in Java. Though you can
    request it by calling Sytem.gc() or its cousin Runtime.getRuntime().gc().
    It's not guaranteed that GC will run immediately as result of calling these
    method. <br>

    <strong>Question 10 - Does Garbage collection occur in permanent generation
      space in JVM?</strong> <br>
    Answer : This is a tricky Garbage collection interview question as many
    programmers are not sure whether PermGen space is part of Java heap space or
    not and since it maintains class Meta data and String pool, whether its
    eligible for garbage collection or not. By the way Garbage Collection does
    occur in PermGen space and if PermGen space is full or cross a threshold, it
    can trigger Full GC. If you look at output of GC you will find that PermGen
    space is also garbage collected. This is why correct sizing of PermGen space
    is important to avoid frequent full GC. You can control size of PermGen
    space by JVM options -XX:PermGenSize and -XX:MaxPermGenSize. <br>
    <br>
    <strong>Question 11 : How to you monitor garbage collection activities? <br>
    </strong>Answer : One of my favorite interview questions on Garbage
    collection, just to check whether candidate has ever monitored GC activities
    or not. You can monitor garbage collection activities either offline or
    real-time. You can use tools like JConsole and VisualVM VM with its Visual
    GC plug-in to monitor real time garbage collection activities and memory
    status of JVM or you can redirect Garbage collection output to a log file
    for offline analysis by using -XlogGC=&lt;PATH&gt; JVM parameter. Anyway you
    should always enable GC options like -XX:PrintGCDetails -X:verboseGC and
    -XX:PrintGCTimeStamps as it doesn't impact application performance much but
    provide useful states for performance monitoring. <br>
    <br>
    Question 12: Look at below Garbage collection output and answer following
    question : <br>
    [GC <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    [ParNew: 1512K-&gt;64K(1512K), 0.0635032 secs] <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    15604K-&gt;13569K(600345K), 0.0636056 secs] <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    [Times: user=0.03 sys=0.00, real=0.06 secs] <br>
    <br>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">1. Is this output of Major Collection or
      Minor Collection ? <br>
      2. Which young Generation Garbage collector is used ? <br>
      3. What is size of Young Generation, Old Generation and total Heap Size? <br>
      4. How much memory is freed from Garbage collection ? <br>
      5. How much time is taken for Garbage collection ?<br>
      6. What is current Occupancy of Young Generation ? </span><br>
    <br>
    This Garbage collection Interview questions is completely based on GC
    output. Following are answers of above GC questions which will not only help
    you to answer these question but also help you to understand and interpret
    GC output. <br>
    Answer 1: It's Minor collection because of "GC" word, In case of Major
    collection, you would see "Full GC". <br>
    <br>
    Answer 2: This output is of multi-threaded Young Generation Garbage
    collector "ParNew", which is used along with CMS concurrent Garbage
    collector. <br>
    <br>
    Answer 3: [1512K] which is written in bracket is total size of Young
    Generation, which include Eden and two survivor space. 1512K on left of
    arrow is occupancy of Yong Generation before GC and 64K is occupancy after
    GC. On the next line value if bracket is total heap size which is (600345K).
    If we subtract size of young generation to total heap size we can calculate
    size of Old Generation. This line also shows occupancy of heap before and
    after Garbage collection. <br>
    <br>
    Answer 4: As answered in previous garbage collection interview question,
    second line shows heap occupancy before and after Garbage collection. If we
    subtract value of right side 13569K, to value on left side 15604K, we can
    get total memory freed by GC. <br>
    <br>
    Answer 5: 0.0636056 secs on second line denotes total time it took to
    collect dead objects during Garbage collection. It also include time taken
    to GC young generation which is shown in first line (0635032 secs). <br>
    <br>
    Answer 6: 64K Here are few more interesting Garbage collection Interview
    question for your practice, I haven't provided answers of all garbage
    collection interview questions. If you know the answer than you can post via
    comments. <br>

    <strong>What is Heap space in Java? </strong><br>
    When a Java program started Java Virtual Machine gets some memory from
    Operating System. Java Virtual Machine or JVM uses this memory for all its
    need and part of this memory is call java heap memory. Heap in Java
    generally located at bottom of address space and move upwards. whenever we
    create object using new operator or by any another means object is allocated
    memory from Heap and When object dies or garbage collected ,memory goes back
    to Heap space in Java, to learn more about garbage collection see how
    garbage collection works in Java. <br>
    <br>
    <strong>How to increase heap size in Java </strong><br>
    Default size of Heap space in Java is 128MB on most of 32 bit Sun's JVM but
    its highly varies from JVM to JVM e.g. default maximum and start heap size
    for the 32-bit Solaris Operating System (SPARC Platform Edition) is
    -Xms=3670K and -Xmx=64M and Default values of heap size parameters on 64-bit
    systems have been increased up by approximately 30%. Also if you are using
    throughput garbage collector in Java 1.5 default maximum heap size of JVM
    would be Physical Memory/4 and default initial heap size would be Physical
    Memory/16. Another way to find default heap size of JVM is to start an
    application with default heap parameters and monitor in using JConsole which
    is available on JDK 1.5 onwards, on VMSummary tab you will be able to see
    maximum heap size. By the way you can increase size of java heap space based
    on your application need and I always recommend this to avoid using default
    JVM heap values. if your application is large and lots of object created you
    can change size of heap space by using JVM options -Xms and -Xmx. Xms
    denotes starting size of Heap while -Xmx denotes maximum size of Heap in
    Java. There is another parameter called -Xmn which denotes Size of new
    generation of Java Heap Space. Only thing is you can not change the size of
    Heap in Java dynamically, you can only provide Java Heap Size parameter
    while starting JVM. I have shared some more useful JVM options related to
    Java Heap space and Garbage collection on my post 10 JVM options Java
    programmer must know, you may find useful. <br>
    <strong>Update: </strong><br>
    Regarding default heap size in Java, from Java 6 update 18 there are
    significant changes in how JVM calculates default heap size in 32 and 64 bit
    machine and on client and server JVM mode:
    <br>
    <ol>
      <li>Initial heap space and maximum heap space is larger for improved
        performance.
      </li>
      <li>Default maximum heap space is 1/2 of physical memory of size upto 192
        bytes and 1/4th of physical memory for size upto 1Gig. So for 1Gig
        machine maximum heap size is 256MB 2.maximum heap size will not be used
        until program creates enough object to fill initial heap space which
        will be much lesser but at-least 8 MB or 1/64th part of Physical memory
        upto 1GB. </li>
      <li>for Server Java virtual machine default maximum heap space is 1G for
        4GB of physical memory on a 32 bit JVM. for 64 bit JVM its 32G for a
        physical memory of 128GB. To learn more about how much memory you can
        set in 32-bit and 64-bit JVM in various operating system e.g. Windows 8,
        Linux, or Solaris, see here. </li>
    </ol>

    <strong>Java Heap and Garbage Collection</strong> <br>
    As we know objects are created inside heap memory and Garbage collection is
    a process which removes dead objects from Java Heap space and returns memory
    back to Heap in Java. For the sake of Garbage collection Heap is divided
    into three main regions named as New Generation, Old or Tenured Generation
    and Perm space. New Generation of Java Heap is part of Java Heap memory
    where newly created object are stored, During the course of application many
    objects created and died but those remain live they got moved to Old or
    Tenured Generation by Java Garbage collector thread on Major or full garbage
    collection. Perm space of Java Heap is where JVM stores Meta data about
    classes and methods, String pool and Class level details. You can see How
    Garbage collection works in Java for more information on Heap in Java and
    Garbage collection. <br>
    <br>
    Heap Space in <br>
    <strong>Java OutOfMemoryError in Java Heap</strong> <br>
    When JVM starts JVM heap space is equal to the initial size of Heap
    specified by -Xms parameter, as application progress more objects get
    created and heap space is expanded to accommodate new objects. JVM also run
    garbage collector periodically to reclaim memory back from dead objects. JVM
    expands Heap in Java some where near to Maximum Heap Size specified by -Xmx
    and if there is no more memory left for creating new object in java heap ,
    JVM throws java.lang.OutOfMemoryError and your application dies. Before
    throwing OutOfMemoryError No Space in Java Heap, JVM tries to run garbage
    collector to free any available space but even after that not much space
    available on Heap in Java it results into OutOfMemoryError. To resolve this
    error you need to understand your application object profile i.e. what kind
    of object you are creating, which objects are taking how much memory etc.
    you can use profiler or heap analyzer to troubleshoot OutOfMemoryError in
    Java. "java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space" error messages denotes
    that Java heap does not have sufficient space and cannot be expanded further
    while "java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: PermGen space" error message comes when
    the permanent generation of Java Heap is full, the application will fail to
    load a class or to allocate an interned string. <br>
    <br>
    <strong>Java Heap dump <br>
    </strong>Java Heap dump is a snapshot of Java Heap Memory at a particular
    time. This is very useful to analyze or troubleshoot any memory leak in Java
    or any Java.lang.OutOfMemoryError. There are tools available inside JDK
    which helps you to take heap dump and there are heap analyzer available tool
    which helps you to analyze java heap dump. You can use "jmap" command to get
    java heap dump, this will create heap dump file and then you can use "jhat -
    Java Heap Analysis Tool" to analyze those heap dumps. <br>
    <br>
    <strong>How to increase Java heap space on Maven and ANT</strong> <br>
    Many times we need to increase heap size of Maven or ANT because once number
    of classes increases build tool requires more memory to process and build
    and often throw OutOfMemoryError which we can avoid by changing or increase
    heap memory of JVM. For details see my post How to increase java heap memory
    for Ant or Maven <br>
    <br>
    <strong>10 Points about Java Heap Space </strong><br>
    <ol>
      <li>Java Heap Memory is part of memory allocated to JVM by Operating
        System.
      </li>
      <li>Whenever we create objects they are created inside Heap in Java. </li>
      <li>Java Heap space is divided into three regions or generation for sake
        of garbage collection called New Generation, Old or tenured Generation
        or Perm Space. Permanent generation is garbage collected during full gc
        in hotspot JVM.
      </li>
      <li>You can increase or change size of Java Heap space by using JVM
        command line option -Xms, -Xmx and -Xmn. don't forget to add word "M" or
        "G" after specifying size to indicate Mega or Gig. for example you can
        set java heap size to 258MB by executing following command java -Xmx256m
        HelloWord. </li>
      <li>You can use either JConsole or Runtime.maxMemory(),
        Runtime.totalMemory(), Runtime.freeMemory() to query about Heap size
        programmatic in Java. See my post How to find memory usage in Java
        program for more details. </li>
      <li>You can use command "jmap" to take Heap dump in Java and "jhat" to
        analyze that heap dump.
      </li>
      <li>Java Heap space is different than Stack which is used to store call
        hierarchy and local variables. </li>
      <li>Java Garbage collector is responsible for reclaiming memory from dead
        object and returning to Java Heap space.
      </li>
      <li>Don't panic when you get java.lang.OutOfMemoryError, sometimes its
        just matter of increasing heap size but if it's recurrent then look for
        memory leak in Java. </li>
      <li>Use Profiler and Heap dump Analyzer tool to understand Java Heap space
        and how much memory is allocated to each object. </li>
